# AnimeLogger
A firefox web extension that helps you log the anime episode you're at while on a streaming site.

This extension is still a work in progress. 

The workspace structure is pretty badly organized and the extension itself is pretty much as bad when it comes to design.
I'm pretty much working on this when I have the time/feel like it, so don't except this to be done any time soon.
